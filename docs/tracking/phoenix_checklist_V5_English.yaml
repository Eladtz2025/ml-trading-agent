Absolutely. Here's the **full action plan in English** for transforming your dashboard into a live, interactive AI-driven interface:

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Replace Static Agent with a Live Backend

### 🧠 Create a Real Agent Class

**File:** `agent/phoenix_agent.py`
**Responsibilities:**

* Load decision logs from `decisions/`, `monitor/`, and `risk/`
* Use context from the current portfolio (e.g., `live/`)
* Clean and summarize insights
* Respond in natural language with justifications

**Sample API:**

```python
@app.post("/agent/ask")
def agent_ask(query: str):
    response = agent.process(query)
    return {"response": response}
```

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Connect UI to Backend Agent

### React Frontend (Vite)

* `src/components/AgentChat.tsx` – input + live conversation stream
* `src/hooks/useAgentChat.ts` – fetches from `/agent/ask`
* Handles user input, loading state, and agent response display

### Python Backend (FastAPI or similar)

* Exposes `/agent/ask` route
* Accepts a query + optional context (portfolio, market state, date)
* Returns structured JSON with text and data summaries

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Explain Model Decisions in Human Terms

The agent will output:

* ❓ Question asked by the user
* 📊 Data retrieved (metrics, model outputs, actions)
* 💡 Explanation:

  > “I chose strategy X because model confidence increased from 0.65 to 0.92, and risk (via Kelly) dropped by 27%.”

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Integrate with Real Decision Logs

* Reads from `decisions/*.md`, `log.py`, `drift_log.json`
* Explains past or upcoming actions:

  > “I bought AAPL because SHAP scores favored it after volatility dropped.”

---

## 🧪 QA and Validation

* Agent always responds (fallback message if no data)
* Context is always fresh (date, live PnL, open positions)
* UI interaction flows without reloads (chat-style)

---

Ready for the first branch:

* Add `phoenix_agent.py`
* Add `/agent/ask` API
* Add basic `AgentChat.tsx` UI component

Shall I proceed to create the GitHub branch and PR?

Foundation:
  Status: done
  Next step: Evaluate reproducibility layer (config + hash + version)
  Notes: MVP architecture complete; ready for stabilization

Data:
  Status: in_progress
  Next step: Enable Parquet caching, validate splits/dividends handling
  Notes: Basic loaders in place; no transformation pipeline

Features:
  Status: in_progress
  Next step: Implement full technical indicator set; benchmark runtime
  Notes: RSI/MACD/ATR partially present; need abstraction layer

Backtest:
  Status: in_progress
  Next step: Add latency, slippage, commissions, Monte Carlo
  Notes: Logic is linear + simplistic

Validation:
  Status: in_progress
  Next step: Integrate leakage detection and championâ€“challenger
  Notes: PSI/KS available but not triggered or tracked

Risk:
  Status: in_progress

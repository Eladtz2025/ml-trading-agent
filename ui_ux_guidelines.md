- Fast response

# Visual Paradigms

- Use consistent widths and padding
- Avoid huge rounds and shadows
- Contained flow, groups and color hints
- Emphasize key moments with type contrast
- Follow platform constraints like background, font, size, etc

- Focus on system uniformity interactions across the app
- Allow estimates to unfold, envelop, and default without click.

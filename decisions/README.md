# Designs - Tracking

This directory should contain human-readable architecture esplanations for the ML-trading agent.

## Guideline

- Use one file per decision to describe rationale, security, tradeoff, etc.
- Each file should have date and name of decision at the top.

example:
- 001-credit-model-sizing.md
- 002-leakage-splits.md

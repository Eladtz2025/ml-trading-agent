# Time Seris machine Learning

## Foundations
- Stationarity, trends test, seasonality
- Local, calendar, seasonal representation
- Windows and shifts
- Classical mistakes: nonstationary assumptions, signal, future leakage
- Meta-learning requires

## Methods
- Direct return with delays to process
correlation and lags
- Time-dependent and causal decomposition
- Spatial effects, autocorrelation based methods

# Performance Optimization

## Timing and Resources
- Profile frequent call structures
- Measure control (latency, cpu), memory
- Use async apis where valid
- Split tasks into logical components

## Speed
- Use fixed seeds
- Systematic seed replication
- Reproducible results via config, seed, data
- Use version hash in file names
- Support underlying model results
